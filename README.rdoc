= Ruby Revealed

Ruby Revealed is a blogging platform for people who choose their blogging platform
based on what language it is written in rather than its feature set.  This will
hopefully be a good place to start if you are a Rubyist and want to be able to
easily extend and enhance your blog. It is also open source and will be discussed
at {Ruby Revealed}[http://rubyrevealed.com].
